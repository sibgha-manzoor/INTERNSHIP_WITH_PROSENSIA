No, don’t think that religion is far away from love and life

And that by abandoning religion you’ll live and love what your heart loves

Or that the days will be better and you’ll see the Life - Dunya - as a rescuing shore

Your religion is a sea of hopes, a shore for the prettiest dreams

Religion isn’t what you think.. this is not allowed, that if forbidden

But Islam is really beautiful, that’s not Islam what you think!

All of its obligations guide us and call us for the good

It forbids us from every way that takes us to the evil.

And Allah is merciful and patient, He always calls for righteousness

In religion, there is prayers and greetings and also happiness and delight

And the religious is who you meet, and find him smiling and as sweet as light

He seeks to build up his Life - Dunya - and he has a delicate behavior and patient

Islam is a peace within us, it plants people’s love in us

Islam is a love ship, pushed by the best feeling

How beautiful life is, if we lived and made Islam the base
